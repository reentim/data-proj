# Data project

This project creates a virtual machine environment with which to easily play
around with Postgres, import data, and make changes according to versioned
schema migrations.

## Setup

1. Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).
2. In a terminal emulator, copy this project with
   [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git): `git clone git@github.com/reentim/dataproj.git`
3. `cd dataproj`
4. `vagrant up`
5. `vagrant ssh`
6. `cd /vagrant`
8. `make create`

## Usage

Now you have a running Postgres server, and a database named `dataproj`. You can
connect to it using a [Postgres
client](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-psql.html) like
`psql` â€” run `psql dataproj`, and at the prompt type `\?` to display help.

Running one-off commands through the Postgres client is one thing. But if you
want to make the results reproducible, and the mistakes reversible, use
migration tooling:

Add to the `Makefile` `download` directive, then run `make download` to download
a CSV dataset.

With the [Standalone migrations
](https://github.com/thuss/standalone-migrations#to-create-a-new-database-migration)
gem, create a table for the dataset. The column names should correspond to the
CSV header line, and for now, it's best to create the columns as `character
varying`. Worry about
[types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/datatype.html) later.

Create another migration to import the data with the [`COPY`
command](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-copy.html), e.g.

```ruby
def up
  execute <<-SQL
    COPY pedestrian_volumes
    FROM '/vagrant/tmp/pedestrian_volume.csv'
    CSV
    HEADER
  SQL
end
```

## TODO
* Configure VM / Postgres server to allow outside connections, e.g. from a GUI
  Postgres client.
